Geeks always face a hard time finding girl friends. If fortunately, a geek has a
girl friend, they are sure that they will find bug in their relationship and
needs a Bugzilla to fix it. Here is one, read on…

> Dear Gnome,

>    Please, have some empathy and help me out.

>    Because of you, my boyfriend is chronically attached to his computer and
>    has ceased to pay attention to me. I try to plan fun things for us to do on
>    the weekends and then he cancels on my because of GNOME conferences! He
>    even went to the Netherlands to GUADEC two weeks ago and left me at home
>    alone for a week! He keeps going to all these conferences and I just don’t
>    know what to do. Apparently there is some Boston Summit thing he keeps
>    talking about?

>    Way back when, he used to talk about Linux every once in a while and I
>    found it nerdy and cute. However, as of late, his obsession has become a
>    large dark gloomy cloud on our relationship. Even when we are away from our
>    apartment, he is perpetually attached via his MAEMO Linux phone.

>    He even tried to put Linux on my computer and I simply could not take it. I
>    came home from work one day and my computer said “UNIX” all over it!
>    Recently, he installed Linux on his mom’s computer and now she is calling
>    me complaining and I don’t know what to do!

>    Please, help me bring my boyfriend back from "Linux Land." His name is
>    Zach. If you find him, you may have to shut off the computer you find him
>    in front of to get him to speak in anything other than “C.” Sometimes he
>    will speak to you in French, but thats only because he has his phone in
>    French. I don’t speak French so this too has become a wedge in our
>    relationship.

>    This is a severe issue. Please fix this.

>    Desperately, Ilana
