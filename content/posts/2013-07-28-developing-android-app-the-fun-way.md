Android is the buzz word right now. This is a great time for developers and
users alike. But we still have the distinction of "developers" and "end
users". That difference is set to blur now.

The pre-requisite for writing an android application was Knowledge of the Java
programming language. With the introduction of Android Scripting Engine (ASE),
Python developers too can join the fun. But still we have the user/developer
distinction. Anyone with a great idea but lack of knowledge of any of the
programming languages cannot participate in the development. But that is going
to disappear with the introduction of Google’s App Inventor.  What is App
Inventor?

Far from the traditional development style of using an editor and compiler, App
Inventor uses the browser as the development environment. It also has the
dependency of JavaWebStart (standalone Java applications can be run from the
network). It works very smoothly on Linux (Fedora 14). It allows you to run the
app you have developed on an emulator or your phone directly. The real advantage
comes from the fact that you design with a drag and drop interface, so you don’t
to peep into XML files for the layout design. So how do you specify the actions
on the objects, or tell this app provides services etc? That’s where the fun is
waiting, just assembling puzzle pieces logically.  How it works?

On installing the APK, it also loads another APK which supports this kind of
framework into the phone, which helps our app to run. The app apk itself is a
set of XML files. But I don’t yet understand how the XML "runs" the application,
but what I know is what ever I do in the App Inventor works flawlessly in my
phone.
