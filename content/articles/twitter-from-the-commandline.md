Twitter has become popular with many of us recently. Most of us are too lazy to
use the web interface to do a update. So there are options like twitter for
firefox, twitgin for pidgin and so on. But still most of are CLI oriented and
rarely visit the GUI. I am one such guy. So when I came to hear about Twitter
API, I was excited and started to write a simple python script to update to
Twitter. You can find the version 1 of the script in this post.

# How to use clt?

You can tweet using the following command:

```console
$ clt [-u username] [-p password] your tweet message here
```

Note that the username is not required if it is set `TWEETUSER` environment
variable. But you can give explicitly if you want to send as a different user.

The following will get the specified userâ€™s last tweet update.

```console
$ clt [-u username] -l
```

You can always refer the options using

```console
$ clt --help
```

The python code for clt is here.


```python
#!/usr/bin/python
