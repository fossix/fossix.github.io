<p>Geeks always face a hard time finding girl friends. If fortunately, a geek has a
girl friend, they are sure that they will find bug in their relationship and
needs a Bugzilla to fix it. Here is one, read on…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Gnome,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Please, have some empathy and help me out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of you, my boyfriend is chronically attached to his computer and
has ceased to pay attention to me. I try to plan fun things for us to do on
the weekends and then he cancels on my because of GNOME conferences! He
even went to the Netherlands to GUADEC two weeks ago and left me at home
alone for a week! He keeps going to all these conferences and I just don’t
know what to do. Apparently there is some Boston Summit thing he keeps
talking about?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Way back when, he used to talk about Linux every once in a while and I
found it nerdy and cute. However, as of late, his obsession has become a
large dark gloomy cloud on our relationship. Even when we are away from our
apartment, he is perpetually attached via his MAEMO Linux phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He even tried to put Linux on my computer and I simply could not take it. I
came home from work one day and my computer said “UNIX” all over it!
Recently, he installed Linux on his mom’s computer and now she is calling
me complaining and I don’t know what to do!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Please, help me bring my boyfriend back from &ldquo;Linux Land.&rdquo; His name is
Zach. If you find him, you may have to shut off the computer you find him
in front of to get him to speak in anything other than “C.” Sometimes he
will speak to you in French, but thats only because he has his phone in
French. I don’t speak French so this too has become a wedge in our
relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a severe issue. Please fix this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Desperately, Ilana</p>
</blockquote>
